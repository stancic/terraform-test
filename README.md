# Terraform Learning Project

A repository for learning terraform. Created environments will be separated by branches.

## Versions

Currently used Terraform version for the project is Terraform v1.3.7

## Outputs

Terraform Outputs are a way to export values that are generated by Terraform.

List of outputs:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |

### Getting the value of an output

Exporting all outputs to a `json` file can be done with the following command:

```bash
terraform output -json > terraform.json
```

### Getting a single output

You can get a single output with the following command:

```bash
```

This mechanism always retrieves the current value of the output. In case of value rotation it will track the latest value after state synchronization.

### Initializing Terraform configuration for local development

Terraform configuration should be initialized with the following command per **environment** folder:

```bash
terraform init
```
